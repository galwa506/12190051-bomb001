Phase_3

//Before diffusing the bomb we need to set a break point at phase3 and at explode bomb function inorder to prevent the explosion of the bomb.
// We can set the break point with the help of the command either with "b" or "break" 

(gdb) b phase_3
Breakpoint 7 at 0x400f15
(gdb) b explode_bomb
Breakpoint 8 at 0x40143d

//After setting the break point, we need to check if it's workinig fine.
//Here, I gave integers "1 2" which is not exactly right but just to test if the bereak point is working fine.

(gdb) run

Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
0 1 1 2 3 5
That's number 2.  Keep going!
1 2
Breakpoint 3, 0x0000000000400ea9 in phase_2 () //This proves that the break point works.

//With the help of command "disas" We will be able to see the assembler code of phase_2 so that we can find the hidden code.
